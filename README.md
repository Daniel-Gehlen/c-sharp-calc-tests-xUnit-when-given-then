## Technical Report: Calculator Development Project with Unit Testing

This technical report aims to provide an overview of the development project of a refined calculator, with a special focus on the developed unit tests and their importance in ensuring the quality and robustness of the solution.

### Project Overview
The project involves the development of a comprehensive calculator with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), along with the implementation of an operation history. The calculator is implemented in .NET Core, ensuring portability and efficiency.

### Unit Testing Strategy
Unit tests play a crucial role in software development as they ensure that each individual component functions as expected. In the calculator project, unit tests were developed for each mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), as well as for the operation history.

### Importance of Unit Testing
- **Quality Assurance**: Unit tests ensure that each functionality of the calculator works correctly, identifying and correcting errors in the code during the development process.
- **Safe Refactoring**: Unit tests allow for safe refactoring of the code as they provide a safety net that alerts about potential regressions after changes.
- **Dynamic Documentation**: Unit tests serve as dynamic documentation of the code, providing clear examples of how to use each component of the calculator and what results to expect.
- **Facilitates Maintenance**: With a comprehensive suite of unit tests, maintaining the calculator becomes easier and less prone to introducing new bugs.

### Test Coverage
Test coverage is a metric that indicates the percentage of the source code exercised by unit tests. In this project, the test coverage was measured at 80%, ensuring good coverage of the calculator's functionalities and operation history.

### Conclusion
The development of unit tests is an essential practice to ensure the quality and robustness of software. In the calculator project, unit tests play a fundamental role in validating the implemented functionalities, ensuring that the calculator is reliable and precise.

The 80% test coverage indicates a commitment to code quality and the reliability of the calculator, providing users with a consistent and error-free experience.

### Next Steps
Next steps include Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) of the project, allowing for automated execution of unit tests on each code change and safe deployment of new versions of the calculator.
